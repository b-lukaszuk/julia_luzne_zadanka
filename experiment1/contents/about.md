My first 'experimental' book entitled (for now):

"Romeo and Julia, where Romeo is basic statistics"

In this book I will explore some basic statistics (the way I see it) with [Julia](https://julialang.org/).

I'm not a statistician, mathematician, or a computer scientist (by education), but a biologist. Nowadays, I'm a programming enthusiast. To be honest, statistics was not my favorite subject when I was at college. I didn't get it then, I got it somewhat better now. Hopefully this will make the book easier to digest, although possibly more biased towards biology.
