# Statistics - introduction {#sec:statistics_intro}

OK, once we got some Julia basics under our belts its time to get familiar with statistics.

First of all, what is statistics anyway?

Hmm, actually I never tried to learn the definition by heart (after all getting such a question during an exam is slim to none). Still, if I were to give a short (2-3 sentences) definition without looking it up I would say something like that.

Statistics is a set of methods for drawing conclusions about big things (populations) based on small things (samples). A statistician observes only a small part of a bigger picture and makes generalization about what he does not see based on what he saw. Given that he saw only a part of the picture he can never be entirely sure of his conclusions.

OK, feel free to visit Wikipedia [see statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics) and see how it did with my definition. The definition given there is probably more accurate and comprehensive, but maybe mine will be easier to grasp for a beginner. 

Anyway, my definition says "can never be entirely sure" so there needs to be some form of measure for the uncertainty, which we will explore in the next section.
