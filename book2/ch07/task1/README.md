# Task 1

[Go to: Table of contents](#table-of-contents)

## Title

Number the Lines in a File

(Part 1, Exercise 144 from the book)

## Description

`task1.jl` contains a program that reads a file contents, adds line numbers and writes it down as another file.

## My notes

Name of the input file and output file will be read from command line args.

## Usage

**WARNING!** The program may accidentally overwrite a file content. Be careful not to do that!

```bash
julia task1.jl input_file.txt output_file.txt
```

e.g.

```bash
julia task1.jl lorem_ipsum.txt lorem_ipsum2.txt
```
