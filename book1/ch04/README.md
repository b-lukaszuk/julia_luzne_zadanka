I think I'll skip the tasks for chapter 4 [see here](https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html#_exercises_5) since they require me to install code from [Think Julia github](https://github.com/BenLauwens/ThinkJulia.jl), i.e.

in REPL

```
(v1.0) pkg> add https://github.com/BenLauwens/ThinkJulia.jl
```

in order to use the turtle utility and I don't want to do this (at least not now).
