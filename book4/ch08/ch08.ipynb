In practice, we can usually ignore low-probability quantities above a finite limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Also under the Poisson model, the interval between events follows an exponential distribution, which is a continuous distribution with quantities from 0 to infinity. Because it is continuous, it is described by a probability density function (PDF) rather than a probability mass function (PMF). But when we use an exponential distribution to compute the likelihood of the data, we can treat densities as unnormalized probabilities.\n",

The gamma distribution has one parameter, denoted $\\alpha$ or alpha, which is also its mean."
