# Description

Selected tasks from Ben Lauwens, Allen Downey "Think Julia: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist".

The book was found [online](https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html).

The tasks will be solved at a whim, it is possible that I will modify some of them.
For better visual clarity I will not use quotations.

Used only for educational purposes.

# Usage example

```bash
julia Task1.jl
```

or

in interactive mode in Emacs, type `M-x ess-julia-mode` then e.g. mark region of code to execute and press `C-c` (it will open REPL).
